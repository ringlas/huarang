List of best-selling books
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This is an incomplete list, which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.
This page provides lists of best-selling single-volume books and book series to date and in any language. "Best-selling" refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources. This list is incomplete because there are many books, such as Don Quixote, The Three Musketeers, Les Mis√©rables, The Adventures of Pinocchio, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, that are commonly cited as "best-selling books" yet have no reliable sales figures. There is a separate section on this page for books known to have sold over 10 million copies but do not have figures for their final sales data.

The Bible, the Qur'an and Quotations from Chairman Mao are widely reported as some of the most printed and also some of the most distributed books worldwide,[1][2][3][4] with hundreds of millions of copies of each of them believed to be in existence. Exact print figures for some such books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of books may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have been excluded from this list of best-selling books for these reasons.
